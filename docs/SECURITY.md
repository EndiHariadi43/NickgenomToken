## Security Measures

### Smart Contract Security
- The contract has been tested with unit tests
- The contract uses OpenZeppelin's audited contracts
- The contract includes custom error handling
- The contract includes rescue functions for misplaced tokens

### Operational Security
- Multi-sig wallet for contract ownership
- Time-locked contract upgrades (if applicable)
- Regular security audits

## Known Security Considerations

### Reentrancy
The contract does not perform external calls in a way that could lead to reentrancy attacks.

### Overflow/Underflow
The contract uses Solidity 0.8.20 which has built-in overflow/underflow protection.

### Access Control
Critical functions are protected by the `onlyOwner` modifier.

### Front-running
Permit functionality is designed to be resistant to front-running attacks.

## Audit History
- [TBD] Initial audit by [Audit Firm]
