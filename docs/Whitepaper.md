# NickgenomToken (NGM) — Whitepaper

**Version:** 1.0 • **Last Updated:** 2025-09-07
**Network:** BNB Smart Chain (BEP-20) • **Contract:** `0x0353Ad4cAD5548dE4230E36D86Ed5536a0BAca16`

---

## 1. Executive Summary
NickgenomToken (NGM) is an **AI-Native Meme Token** on BNB Smart Chain designed to combine community-driven growth with practical Web3 utility. NGM emphasizes **transparency**, **simplicity**, and **deflationary mechanics** (burn), while enabling integrations with DeFi and AI-powered applications via **EIP‑2612 Permit**.

**Core properties**
- Fixed supply: **1,000,000,000,000 NGM** (18 decimals)
- Open, audited base primitives via **OpenZeppelin v5**
- No tax, no blacklist, no transfer limits
- Burnable (`burn`, `burnFrom`) & gasless approvals (`permit`)

---

## 2. Vision & Mission
**Vision.** Build a global community token that bridges **AI** and **Blockchain**, allowing users to participate in a transparent, permissionless economy for AI-powered experiences.

**Mission.**
1) Drive Web3 adoption through accessible tokenomics and simple UX.  
2) Provide meaningful **utility** (airdrop, staking, access to AI tools) to foster sustained demand.  
3) Maintain transparency: verifiable contracts, public roadmap, and open governance signals.

## 4. Tokenomics
Initial allocation (flexible, community-guided; subject to on-chain disclosures):

| Allocation                      | Target % | Description |
|---------------------------------|---------:|-------------|
| Liquidity (DEX)                 | 20%      | Seed PancakeSwap pools (NGM/BNB). |
| Community Airdrop               | 15%      | Merkle airdrops to early supporters. |
| Staking / Holder Rewards        | 15%      | Incentives for long-term holding. |
| Marketing & Partnerships        | 10%      | Growth campaigns, collabs, integrations. |
| Team / Development Reserve      | 10%      | Long-term dev, transparently vested. |
| Burn Allocation                 | 30%      | Scheduled/triggered burns to enforce scarcity. |

> **Note:** Actual on-chain movements (LP adds, burns, airdrops) are announced via official channels, and verifiable on BscScan.

## 5. Utility
- **DEX Liquidity & Trading.** NGM pairs (e.g., NGM/BNB) on PancakeSwap for free-market price discovery.  
- **Airdrops (MerkleDistributor).** Gas‑efficient distribution to allowlisted wallets, driving community growth.  
- **Staking (Planned).** Reward long-term holders with emissions funded from the rewards allocation.  
- **AI Access (R&D).** Token‑gated access to AI bots/tools; discounts or credits paid in NGM.  
- **Burn Events.** Periodic manual or programmatic burns to reduce circulating supply.

## 7. Governance & Transparency
- **Fair‑style** design: no taxes, no blacklist, minimal privileged functions.  
- **Open source.** Contracts and scripts are published on GitHub.  
- **Community input.** Polls and discussions via Telegram/X; future lightweight DAO signalling.  

---

## 8. Security
- **OpenZeppelin v5** primitives for ERC‑20/Permit/Burnable/Ownable.  
- **No mint** functions post‑deploy; fixed supply enforced by contract.  
- BscScan verification for bytecode/source parity.  
- Future third‑party review/audit (subject to treasury).  

> Users should perform independent research. Never share private keys. Interact only with the official, checksummed address above.

---

## 9. Risk Disclosure
- **Market risk.** NGM price is driven by market supply/demand; volatility is expected.  
- **Operational risk.** Delays/changes in roadmap due to market/regulatory/technical factors.  
- **No investment advice.** NGM is a community token; no guarantees of profit or returns.
