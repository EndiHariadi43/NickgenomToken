# NickgenomFactory â€” User Guide

NickgenomFactory is a **mini launchpad contract** on BNB Smart Chain that allows anyone to create a simple ERC-20 token by paying a deployment fee in BNB.  
Each new token deployed through this factory uses the **SimpleERC20** implementation (based on OpenZeppelin).

## ðŸ§­ How to Deploy a New Token

1. Open the contract page on BscScan â†’ go to the **Contract** tab â†’ **Write Contract**.  
2. Click **Connect to Web3** (Binance Wallet / MetaMask).  
3. Fill in the **deployToken** function parameters:
   - `name_` â†’ token name (e.g., `MyToken`)  
   - `symbol_` â†’ token symbol (e.g., `MTK`)  
   - `initialSupply` â†’ initial amount *with 18 decimals*.  
     - Example: 1,000 tokens = `1000000000000000000000`  
   - `mintTo` â†’ address to receive the tokens (set `0x0` to default to the sender)
4. In the **Value** field, enter the deployment fee according to `deployFeeWei` (e.g., `0.01 BNB`).  
   - You can check the current fee in the **Read Contract** tab â†’ `deployFeeWei`.
5. Click **Write** â†’ confirm the transaction in your wallet.  
6. Once confirmed, the **TokenDeployed** event will appear, showing the address of the newly created token.
